What is ConStrain?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**ConStrain** is an easy-to-use python package with functions that
can be used in literate programming to simulate steps of a strain 
construction cycle from generating genetic parts, to designing a 
combinatorial library along with instructions for the assembly. 
A fully integrated LIMS system is presented to keep track of samples 
and allocation through both a commercial Benchling API and a low-level CSV file database. 

Here, we demonstrate the use of ConStrain in a complex machine learning-guided
metabolic engineering task. We envision that literate programming for biology 
can be adapted for any experimental workflow and be mixed and matched for the 
benefit of the user. As this tool is built to be flexible through its open-source
Python platform, future repetitive tasks can be automated and thus increase 
the speed at which we engineer biology. 

Curious about how you can build strains easier and faster? Head over to our `Google Colab notebooks <https://github.com/hiyama341/ConStrain/tree/main/colab_notebooks>`__
and give it a try.
